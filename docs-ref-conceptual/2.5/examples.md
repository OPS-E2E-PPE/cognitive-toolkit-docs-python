# Examples

The best way to learn about the APIs is to look at the
following examples in the [CNTK clone root]/Examples directory:

-  [MNIST](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/release/2.1/Examples/Image/Classification/MLP/Python/SimpleMNIST.py) 
   A fully connected feed-forward model for classification of MNIST
   images. (Follow the instructions in
   [Examples/Image/DataSets/MNIST/README.md](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/release/2.1/Examples/Image/DataSets/MNIST/README.md) to get the MNIST data set)

-  [TrainResNet_CIFAR10](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/release/2.1/Examples/Image/Classification/ResNet/Python/TrainResNet_CIFAR10.py)
   An image classification ResNet model for training on the CIFAR image
   dataset. (Follow the instructions in
   [Examples/Image/DataSets/CIFAR-10/README.md](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/release/2.1/Examples/Image/DataSets/CIFAR-10/README.md) to get the CIFAR dataset
   and convert it to the CNTK supported format)

-  [SequenceClassification](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/release/2.1/Examples/SequenceClassification/SimpleExample/Python/SequenceClassification.py)
   An LSTM sequence classification model for text data.

-  [Sequence2Sequence](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/release/2.1/Examples/SequenceToSequence/CMUDict/Python/Sequence2Sequence.py)
   A sequence to sequence grapheme to phoneme translation model that
   trains on the CMUDict corpus.

-  [NumpyInterop](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/release/2.1/Examples/LanguageUnderstanding/ATIS/Python/LanguageUnderstanding.py) - Language Understanding.

- [Video](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/release/2.1/Examples/Video/GettingStarted/Python/Conv3D_UCF11.py) - Basic 3D convolution networks for deep learning on video tasks.
